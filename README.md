# Reason for the project: 
    This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase three training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our use of JavaScript and React to manipulate and change the DOM, and also the use of HTML and CSS to develop and design webpages. To create a backend API for our application, we utilized Sinatra to create CRUD responses, Activerecord to make SQL commands, and Ruby to create classes and endpoints.

# Project Description: 
    The Best Friend Business is a management resource for organizations in the business of helping people find their best friends. As a shelter resource, it lets you keep track of all the animals in your system, the adoption applications submitted for every animal, and shelter locationsâ€”all in one convenient place! 

    On the animals page, the organization can view all the animals in their system, including details such as their name, breed, and shelter location. Also, the organization is able to add an animal, update/edit the animal, or delete the animal from the database. There is a search feature, where animals can be found by any of their details, and there is a filter to view by only dogs or cats.
    
    Similarly on the applications page and shelter page, you can search, add, update, and delete the items contained on those pages.


# Learnings and Struggles:
    During the course of building this project, we gathered more experience with handling and manipulating DOM elements, we struggled a lot with our page styling on CSS flexbox and building relations with our tables. In future iterations, we would want to improve upon the layout by learning more about how flexboxes work. We would also like to incorporate a feature that allows the organization to filter animals without any adoption applications to nearby adoption events.

# Acknowledgments:
    We used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
